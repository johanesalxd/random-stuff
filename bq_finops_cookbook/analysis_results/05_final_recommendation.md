# Final Recommendation

**Project:** your-project-id
**Region:** US
**Analysis Period:** Last 30 days
**Analysis Date:** October 14, 2025

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of 30 days of BigQuery usage data, this project exhibits a highly sporadic, unpredictable workload pattern that is best served by on-demand (pay-as-you-go) pricing. No reservation commitment is recommended.

## Current State Summary

### Slot Metrics
- **p10:** 0.0 slots
- **p25:** 0.0 slots
- **p50:** 0.0 slots (median)
- **p75:** 0.0 slots
- **p95:** 1.4 slots
- **max:** 190.7 slots
- **Average:** 2.7 slots
- **Standard Deviation:** 20.3 slots

### Workload Characteristics
- **Variability:** Coefficient of Variation = 7.52 (Extremely High)
- **Burstiness:** Peak-to-Average Ratio = 70.6 (Extremely High)
- **Classification:** Sporadic, unpredictable workload with long idle periods and occasional large bursts

### Usage Summary
- **Total Slot-Hours:** 387.0 over 30 days
- **Job Count:** 756 queries
- **Active Hours:** 143 out of 720 hours (20% of time)
- **Top Consumer:** Single project (your-project-id)
- **Primary User:** your-email-id
- **Data Scanned:** 1.4 TB

### Peak Usage Patterns
- **Primary Peak:** Monday 02:00-04:00 UTC (10:00 AM - 12:00 PM Singapore time)
- **Activity Concentration:** Week 39 accounted for 97% of all usage
- **Current Configuration:** On-demand (no existing reservations)

## Recommended Strategy

### Choice: Stay On-Demand (PAYG)

**Reasoning:**

1. **Below Minimum Threshold:** Average usage (2.7 slots) and all percentiles (p10-p95) are well below the 50-slot minimum for reservations

2. **Extreme Variability:** Coefficient of Variation of 7.52 indicates highly unpredictable usage that cannot be efficiently served by committed capacity

3. **Sporadic Activity:** The project is active only 20% of the time (143 hours out of 720), with 75% of hours showing zero slot usage

4. **Poor Reservation Economics:** Simulation shows that even a minimal 50-slot reservation would be utilized at only 2%, resulting in 98% waste of committed capacity

5. **Concentrated Usage:** 97% of usage occurred in a single week (Week 39), suggesting this may be a monthly reporting cycle rather than sustained workload

6. **Single User Environment:** All activity from one user eliminates the need for multi-tenant resource allocation

## Optimization Actions

### Priority 1: Optimize High-Impact Query (Immediate)

**Target:** Job ID 645bcfeb-785c-4a4c-9736-d5b649c2fdc5

**Impact:** This single query consumed 254 slot-hours (66% of monthly total)

**Actions:**
1. Retrieve and analyze the query execution plan
2. Review JOIN operations for optimization opportunities
3. Check for missing partitioning or clustering on tables involved
4. Consider breaking the query into smaller, incremental steps
5. Implement query result caching if the query runs repeatedly

**Expected Savings:** Potential 50-66% reduction in monthly slot consumption

### Priority 2: Enable Query Result Caching (Quick Win)

**Actions:**
1. Enable query result caching in BigQuery settings
2. Review query patterns to identify repeated analytical queries
3. Educate users on leveraging cached results

**Expected Savings:** 10-20% reduction for repeated queries

### Priority 3: Monitor and Schedule Recurring Workloads (If Applicable)

**Actions:**
1. Confirm if Week 39 pattern represents a monthly reporting cycle
2. If recurring, schedule similar workloads during off-peak hours (UTC 00:00-02:00)
3. Implement Cloud Scheduler or Airflow for automated batch processing

**Expected Savings:** Minimal cost savings, but improved resource availability during business hours

### Priority 4: Investigate Long-Running Queries

**Target:** Queries with long duration but minimal data processing

**Actions:**
1. Review jobs with null GB processed but 5-9 minute runtimes
2. Identify potential inefficiencies (e.g., unnecessary sorting, suboptimal JOINs)
3. Optimize or refactor as needed

**Expected Savings:** 5-10% improvement in query performance

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Query Optimization

```bash
# Retrieve the execution plan for the high-impact query
bq show --format=prettyjson -j 645bcfeb-785c-4a4c-9736-d5b649c2fdc5 > query_analysis.json

# Review the query details
cat query_analysis.json | jq '.statistics.query'
```

### Step 2: Enable Query Caching

Query result caching is enabled by default in BigQuery. Verify settings:

```bash
# Check project-level settings
bq show --project_id=your-project-id
```

### Step 3: Set Up Monitoring

Create a monitoring dashboard to track:
- Daily slot consumption
- Query execution times
- Bytes scanned per query
- Slot contention events

```sql
-- Save this query as a scheduled query to run daily
SELECT
  DATE(creation_time) as date,
  COUNT(*) as query_count,
  ROUND(SUM(total_slot_ms) / (1000 * 60 * 60), 1) as slot_hours,
  ROUND(SUM(total_bytes_processed) / POW(1024, 4), 2) as tb_scanned
FROM
  `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT
WHERE
  creation_time >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
  AND job_type = 'QUERY'
  AND statement_type != 'SCRIPT'
GROUP BY
  date
ORDER BY
  date DESC;
```

## Validation Criteria

After implementing optimizations, monitor for:

- [ ] Reduction in average query execution time (target: 20-30% improvement)
- [ ] Decrease in slot-hours consumed per week (target: 50% reduction)
- [ ] No increase in query failures or errors
- [ ] Maintained or improved query result accuracy

## Cost Projection

### Current Monthly Cost (Estimated)

Based on 387 slot-hours over 30 days:
- **On-Demand Pricing:** $387 × $0.04/slot-hour = **$15.48/month**
- **Annual Cost:** ~$186

### With Optimization (Projected)

If Priority 1 optimization achieves 50% reduction:
- **Optimized Monthly Cost:** ~$7.74/month
- **Annual Savings:** ~$93

### Reservation Comparison (Not Recommended)

Minimum 50-slot reservation:
- **Monthly Cost:** 50 slots × 730 hours × $0.04/hour = **$1,460/month**
- **Utilization:** 2%
- **Waste:** $1,444/month (98% of commitment unused)

**Conclusion:** On-demand pricing is 99% more cost-effective than any reservation commitment for this workload.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (This Week):**
   - Analyze and optimize job 645bcfeb-785c-4a4c-9736-d5b649c2fdc5
   - Verify query result caching is enabled
   - Set up basic monitoring dashboard

2. **Short-term (Next 2 Weeks):**
   - Review and optimize other long-running queries
   - Implement scheduled monitoring queries
   - Document optimization results

3. **Ongoing (Monthly):**
   - Re-run this analysis monthly to track trends
   - Monitor for changes in usage patterns
   - Adjust optimization strategies as needed

4. **Re-evaluation Trigger:**
   - If average slot usage exceeds 50 slots for 3 consecutive months
   - If usage pattern becomes more predictable (CV < 1.0)
   - If project scope expands significantly

## Conclusion

The your-project-id project is optimally served by on-demand pricing. The sporadic, unpredictable usage pattern makes any reservation commitment economically inefficient. Focus should be on query optimization to reduce the 66% of consumption attributed to a single long-running query, rather than on workload management infrastructure.

The current monthly cost of ~$15 is minimal and does not justify the complexity or cost of reservation management. Continue with on-demand pricing and implement the recommended query optimizations for maximum cost efficiency.
