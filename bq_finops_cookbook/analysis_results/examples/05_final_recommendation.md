# Final Recommendation

## Current State Summary
- **Slot Metrics:** p10=0.0, p25=0.0, p50=0.0, p95=1.4, max=190.7
- **Variability:** CV=7.48 (Highly Variable)
- **Burstiness:** High burst (median usage is zero)
- **Top 3 Projects:** `your-project-id` (100% of usage)
- **Peak Hours:** A single, major event on Monday, September 29th between 02:00 and 04:00 UTC.
- **Current Configuration:** On-Demand (PAYG)

## Recommended Strategy
**Choice:** Stay On-Demand (PAYG)

**Reasoning:**
Your workload is characterized by very low average usage with infrequent, high-intensity bursts. This pattern is a perfect fit for the on-demand model, as a committed reservation would be severely underutilized (less than 2% average utilization), leading to unnecessary costs. The on-demand model ensures you only pay for the compute resources you consume during peak periods.

**Configuration:**
- No changes are needed. Continue with the default on-demand billing model.

## Optimization Actions
1.  **Optimize Long-Running Queries:**
    - **Action:** Investigate the two longest-running queries, which are the primary drivers of your peak slot consumption and cost.
      - `job_id: 645bcfeb-785c-4a4c-9736-d5b649c2fdc5` (2032 seconds)
      - `job_id: 094c6ec4-fc6a-4847-8c61-5b1197c03f66` (171 seconds)
    - **Impact:** Optimizing these queries (e.g., by improving joins, adding filtering, or using partitioning/clustering on the underlying tables) can significantly reduce the size of the usage spikes and lower your on-demand costs.

2.  **Address Invalid Queries:**
    - **Action:** Review the `invalidQuery` errors in your job history.
    - **Impact:** These errors represent wasted developer time and potential issues in your data processing logic. Fixing them will improve the reliability of your analytics.

3.  **Monitor Usage:**
    - **Action:** Continue to monitor your slot usage on a monthly basis to ensure the workload pattern does not change significantly.
    - **Impact:** If the average slot usage begins to rise consistently, or if the workload becomes less bursty, this analysis should be re-run to determine if a reservation becomes cost-effective.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Query Optimization
- Use the BigQuery UI to inspect the execution graph and details for the two job IDs listed above to identify performance bottlenecks.

### Step 2: Error Resolution
- Filter your job history for jobs with `error_result.reason = "invalidQuery"` to identify and fix the problematic SQL.

### Step 3: Monitoring Setup
- No immediate setup is required. The on-demand model requires no configuration. Review your monthly GCP bill for BigQuery spending to track costs.

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] **Cost Reduction:** Track on-demand spending to see if query optimizations lead to a reduction in costs during peak usage.
- [ ] **Error Rate:** The number of `invalidQuery` errors should decrease over time.
- [ ] **Performance:** The duration of the top queries should be significantly reduced after optimization.

## Next Steps
1.  Review and approve this recommendation.
2.  Prioritize the optimization of the identified long-running queries.
3.  Re-run this analysis in 3-6 months to validate that the on-demand model is still the most effective strategy.
