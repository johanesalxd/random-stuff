# Optimization Opportunities (30-Day Analysis)

## Slot Contention
- **Jobs with Contention:** 2
- **Impact:** Two jobs experienced slot contention, indicating that for a period, they could not acquire all the slots they needed. This is expected during the large, infrequent bursts in an on-demand model.
- **Recommendation:** Since these events are rare, no action is required. The on-demand model is functioning as expected by handling these bursts.

## Job Error Analysis
| Error Reason | Error Count | Error % | Capacity-Related |
|--------------|-------------|---------|------------------|
| invalidQuery | 30 | 83.3% | No |
| stopped | 2 | 5.6% | No |

**Capacity-Related Errors:**
- **rateLimitExceeded:** 0 occurrences (0%)
- **resourcesExceeded:** 0 occurrences (0%)

**Recommendations:**
- There are no capacity-related errors. All significant errors are `invalidQuery`, which are related to the SQL syntax itself, not performance or capacity. This confirms that the on-demand model is sufficient for your workload's performance needs.

## Expensive Queries
| User | Query Count | TB Scanned | Avg GB/Query |
|------|------------|------------|--------------|
| your-email-id | 729 | 1.4 | 2.14 |

**Recommendations:**
- The user `your-email-id` is responsible for all significant data scanning.
- While 1.4 TB over 30 days is not excessive, the queries causing the large slot usage spikes should be reviewed for optimization opportunities, such as improved filtering, partitioning, or clustering.

## Slow Queries
| Job ID | User | Duration (s) | GB Processed |
|--------|------|--------------|--------------|
| 645bcfeb-785c-4a4c-9736-d5b649c2fdc5 | your-email-id | 2032 | 13.12 |
| 094c6ec4-fc6a-4847-8c61-5b1197c03f66 | your-email-id | 171 | 13.12 |

**Recommendations:**
- The two longest-running queries are the primary drivers of the slot usage spikes and are clear candidates for optimization.
- The top query ran for over 33 minutes. Optimizing this single query could significantly reduce the peak slot demand and overall cost.

## Reservation Simulation
| Reservation Size | Hours Within | Hours Exceeding | Avg Utilization % |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 50 | 142 | 2 | 2.0% |
| 100 | 142 | 2 | 1.7% |
| 500 | 144 | 0 | 0.5% |

**Optimal Size:** The simulation confirms that any fixed reservation would be severely underutilized (less than 2% utilization). This reinforces the recommendation to stay with the on-demand model.
