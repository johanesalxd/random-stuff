## Slot Contention Analysis

**Jobs with Contention:** 2 queries experienced slot contention

| Job ID | User | Duration (s) | Avg Slots |
|--------|------|--------------|-----------|
| 645bcfeb-785c-4a4c-9736-d5b649c2fdc5 | your-email-id | 2,032 | 449.9 |
| 094c6ec4-fc6a-4847-8c61-5b1197c03f66 | your-email-id | 171 | 1,642.9 |

**Impact:** Two queries experienced slot contention, indicating they were competing for available on-demand slots. The first query ran for 34 minutes using an average of 450 slots, while the second used 1,643 slots for 3 minutes.

**Recommendation:** These queries would benefit from optimization or running during off-peak hours. However, given the sporadic nature of the workload, slot contention is not a systemic issue.

## Expensive Queries by Data Scanned

| User | Query Count | TB Scanned | Avg GB/Query |
|------|------------|------------|--------------|
| your-email-id | 707 | 1.4 | 2.21 |

**Analysis:**
- Total data scanned (1.4 TB) is modest for a 30-day period
- Average 2.21 GB per query is reasonable and suggests well-scoped queries
- No queries scanning excessive amounts of data (>100 GB)

**Recommendations:**
- Current query patterns are efficient
- No immediate partitioning or clustering optimizations required
- Continue monitoring if data volumes grow significantly

## Slow Queries Analysis

Top 5 slowest queries:

| Job ID | Duration (s) | GB Processed | Slot-Hours |
|--------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| 645bcfeb-785c-4a4c-9736-d5b649c2fdc5 | 2,032 | 13.12 | 254.0 |
| 333867b3-f4bd-4430-8f1c-c6c0c9e5135e | 560 | null | 1.9 |
| 1d8ef777-941d-44f4-a57e-764e7f8de47c | 474 | null | 1.7 |
| f954e819-ac31-4ad4-bcb6-1c96a20724f5 | 429 | null | 1.7 |
| 05ead11a-1d86-4765-ad58-bac67eea8cb1 | 336 | null | 1.2 |

**Key Findings:**
1. **Longest Query:** Job 645bcfeb ran for 34 minutes, processing 13.12 GB and consuming 254 slot-hours
2. **Long-Running Jobs:** Several queries took 5-9 minutes with minimal data processing (null GB), suggesting potential inefficiencies
3. **Optimization Opportunity:** The 34-minute query consumed 66% of total slot-hours for the month

**Recommendations:**
1. Investigate job 645bcfeb-785c-4a4c-9736-d5b649c2fdc5 for optimization opportunities
2. Review queries with long duration but null/low data processing for potential inefficiencies
3. Consider breaking down long-running queries into smaller, more manageable chunks
4. Implement query result caching where appropriate

## Reservation Simulation

Analysis of how different reservation sizes would have performed:

| Reservation Size | Hours Within | Hours Exceeding | Avg Utilization | Avg Utilization % |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 50 slots | 141 | 2 | 1.0 | 2.0% |
| 100 slots | 141 | 2 | 1.7 | 1.7% |
| 500 slots | 143 | 0 | 2.7 | 0.5% |

**Analysis:**
- **50-slot reservation:** Would be underutilized 98% of the time, with 2 hours exceeding capacity
- **100-slot reservation:** Even worse utilization at 1.7%, still with 2 hours of spillover
- **500-slot reservation:** Would contain all usage but at only 0.5% utilization

**Conclusion:** No reservation size makes economic sense for this workload. The sporadic usage pattern (143 hours of activity over 720 hours in a month = 20% time active) combined with highly variable slot requirements makes on-demand pricing optimal.

## Cost Optimization Opportunities

### Priority 1: Query Optimization
- **Target:** Job 645bcfeb-785c-4a4c-9736-d5b649c2fdc5 (254 slot-hours)
- **Potential Savings:** Up to 66% of monthly slot consumption
- **Action:** Analyze query execution plan and optimize JOIN operations, add appropriate indexes/clustering

### Priority 2: Workload Scheduling
- **Target:** Batch jobs currently running during peak hours
- **Potential Savings:** Minimal (workload is already sporadic)
- **Action:** If Week 39 pattern repeats monthly, schedule similar workloads during off-peak hours

### Priority 3: Query Result Caching
- **Target:** Repeated analytical queries
- **Potential Savings:** Reduce redundant processing
- **Action:** Enable query result caching and review query patterns for reuse opportunities
