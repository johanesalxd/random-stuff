## Top 10 General Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Geographic Density Mapping

**Business Question:** *Where are places concentrated across Indonesian cities?*

**Query:**
```sql
-- Geographic density heatmap for any city
SELECT
  geo_txt,

    AND business_status = 'OPERATIONAL'
  GROUP BY geo_txt
)
ORDER BY total_count DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Visualization:**

## Best Practices

### Query Optimization

**1. Always Use Aggregation Threshold**
```sql
SELECT WITH AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD
  -- Your aggregated query
```
- Required for privacy protection
- Results only returned if count ≥ 5
- Prevents individual place identification

**2. Filter Early and Often**
```sql
WHERE
  business_status = 'OPERATIONAL'  -- Filter closed places
  AND locality_names IS NOT NULL   -- Remove nulls early
  AND 'restaurant' IN UNNEST(types)  -- Type filtering
```

**3. Use Appropriate Grid Sizes**
- **0.005 degrees** (~550m): Fine-grained urban analysis
- **0.01 degrees** (~1.1km): Standard city analysis (recommended)
- **0.02 degrees** (~2.2km): Regional overview
- **0.05 degrees** (~5.5km): Province-level analysis

**4. Optimize Geographic Queries**
```sql
-- Good: Use ST_SNAPTOGRID for aggregation
ST_ASTEXT(ST_SNAPTOGRID(point, 0.01))

-- Good: Use ST_DWITHIN for proximity
ST_DWITHIN(point1, point2, 500)  -- 500 meters

-- Avoid: Complex geographic calculations in WHERE
```

**5. Handle NULL Values**
```sql
-- Always check for NULL in critical fields
WHERE rating IS NOT NULL
  AND administrative_area_level_3_name IS NOT NULL

-- Use NULLIF for division
ROUND(count1 / NULLIF(count2, 0), 2)
```

### Common Patterns

**Pattern 1: Geographic Density**
```sql
SELECT WITH AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD
  ST_ASTEXT(ST_SNAPTOGRID(point, 0.01)) AS geo_txt,
  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM table
WHERE filters
GROUP BY geo_txt
```

**Pattern 2: Multi-City Comparison**
```sql
WITH city_stats AS (
  SELECT WITH AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD
    locality,
    COUNT(*) AS count,
    AVG(metric) AS avg_metric
  FROM table, UNNEST(locality_names) AS locality
  WHERE locality IN ('City1', 'City2', 'City3')
  GROUP BY locality
)
SELECT * FROM city_stats
```

**Pattern 3: Quality Distribution**
```sql
SELECT WITH AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD
  CASE
    WHEN rating >= 4.5 THEN 'Excellent'
    WHEN rating >= 4.0 THEN 'Good'
    ELSE 'Average'
  END AS category,
  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM table
WHERE rating IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY category
```

**Pattern 4: Service Feature Analysis**
```sql
SELECT WITH AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD
  COUNT(*) AS total,
  COUNTIF(feature = true) AS has_feature,
  ROUND(COUNTIF(feature = true) / COUNT(*) * 100, 1) AS pct
FROM table
WHERE filters
```

**Pattern 5: Operating Hours Check**
```sql
COUNTIF(EXISTS(
  SELECT 1 FROM UNNEST(regular_opening_hours.monday) AS hours
  WHERE hours.start_time <= TIME '09:00:00'
  AND hours.end_time >= TIME '17:00:00'
)) AS open_during_hours
```

### Data Quality Considerations

**1. Missing Data**
- Not all fields populated for all places
- Accessibility fields often sparse (~10% coverage)
- Price level varies by place type
- Operating hours may be incomplete

**2. Data Freshness**
- Regular updates from Google Maps
- Business status may lag real-world changes
- Ratings and reviews update continuously

**3. Aggregation Threshold**
- Minimum count of 5 required
- May hide small-scale patterns
- Adjust grid size if no results

**4. Type Classification**
- Places can have multiple types
- Use `types` array for comprehensive filtering
- `primary_type` for main classification

### Visualization Best Practices

**BigQuery Studio Heatmaps:**
1. Use geography column named `geo`
2. Choose appropriate data column
3. Select color scheme based on message:
   - **Viridis**: Density (dark = high)
   - **Red-Yellow-Green**: Quality (green = good)
   - **Red**: Intensity/opportunity (red = hot)
4. Adjust circle radius (15-20 pixels typical)
5. Set opacity (70-80% for overlapping circles)

**Looker Studio Dashboards:**
1. Use custom queries for flexibility
2. Create filters for interactivity
3. Combine maps with tables/charts
4. Add scorecards for key metrics

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Query without `WITH AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD`
- Assume all fields are populated
- Use overly fine grid sizes (< 0.005)
- Ignore NULL values in calculations
- Filter after aggregation when possible before

✅ **Do:**
- Always use aggregation threshold
- Check for NULL values
- Use appropriate grid sizes
- Filter early in WHERE clause
- Test queries with LIMIT first

## Query Patterns

### Template: Basic Density Map
```sql
SELECT
  geo_txt,
  ST_GEOGFROMTEXT(geo_txt) AS geo,
  count,
  avg_metric
FROM (
  SELECT WITH AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD
    ST_ASTEXT(ST_SNAPTOGRID(point, 0.01)) AS geo_txt,
    COUNT(*) AS count,
    AVG(metric) AS avg_metric
  FROM `your-project-id.places_insights___id.places`
  WHERE
    'CITY_NAME' IN UNNEST(locality_names)
    AND 'TYPE' IN UNNEST(types)
    AND business_status = 'OPERATIONAL'
  GROUP BY geo_txt
)
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

### Template: Quality Analysis
```sql
SELECT WITH AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD
  CASE
    WHEN rating >= 4.5 THEN 'Excellent (4.5+)'
    WHEN rating >= 4.0 THEN 'Good (4.0-4.5)'
    WHEN rating >= 3.5 THEN 'Average (3.5-4.0)'
    ELSE 'Below Average (<3.5)'
  END AS rating_category,
  COUNT(*) AS count,
  ROUND(AVG(user_rating_count), 1) AS avg_reviews
FROM `your-project-id.places_insights___id.places`
WHERE
  'CITY_NAME' IN UNNEST(locality_names)
  AND 'TYPE' IN UNNEST(types)
  AND business_status = 'OPERATIONAL'
  AND rating IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY rating_category
ORDER BY rating_category DESC;
```

### Template: White Space Analysis
```sql
WITH commercial_activity AS (
  SELECT WITH AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD
    ST_ASTEXT(ST_SNAPTOGRID(point, 0.01)) AS geo_txt,
    COUNT(*) AS total_businesses,
    COUNTIF('COMMERCIAL_TYPE' IN UNNEST(types)) AS commercial_count,
    COUNTIF('TARGET_TYPE' IN UNNEST(types)) AS target_count
  FROM `your-project-id.places_insights___id.places`
  WHERE
    'CITY_NAME' IN UNNEST(locality_names)
    AND business_status = 'OPERATIONAL'
  GROUP BY geo_txt
  HAVING commercial_count > 0
)
SELECT
  geo_txt,
  ST_GEOGFROMTEXT(geo_txt) AS geo,
  commercial_count,
  target_count,
  ROUND(commercial_count / NULLIF(target_count, 0), 2) AS opportunity_score
FROM commercial_activity
WHERE target_count < THRESHOLD
  AND commercial_count > MIN_COMMERCIAL
ORDER BY opportunity_score DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
