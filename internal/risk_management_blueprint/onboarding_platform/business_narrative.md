# Business Narrative: Onboarding Risk Assessment Platform on Google Cloud

## 1. Executive Summary

In the competitive landscape of digital financial services, the onboarding experience is critical. Every new user or merchant represents both an opportunity and a risk. Legacy onboarding systems that rely on manual reviews, fragmented data sources, and siloed risk checks create friction for legitimate customers while failing to catch sophisticated fraudsters.

This document outlines a strategic vision for transforming your onboarding risk assessment capabilities by building a **unified, intelligent, and real-time platform on Google Cloud**. By consolidating all risk evaluation components into a single orchestrated system, you can approve good customers faster, block fraudulent applications more effectively, and dramatically reduce operational costs.

## 2. The Challenge: The Hidden Costs of Fragmented Onboarding

Current onboarding systems that rely on disconnected risk checks and manual processes create significant business challenges:

| Pain Point | Business Impact |
|:---|:---|
| **Slow Onboarding Times** | Legitimate customers abandon the process due to delays, resulting in lost revenue and poor user experience. |
| **High False Positive Rates** | Overly conservative rules reject good customers, requiring costly manual reviews and creating customer frustration. |
| **Missed Fraud** | Sophisticated fraudsters exploit gaps between disconnected systems, leading to chargebacks and compliance issues. |
| **Manual Review Bottlenecks** | Operations teams spend excessive time on routine cases that could be automated, increasing costs and slowing growth. |
| **Compliance Complexity** | Proving KYC/AML compliance is difficult when data and decisions are scattered across multiple systems. |
| **Limited Adaptability** | Adding new risk checks or updating rules requires coordinating changes across multiple systems, slowing innovation. |

## 3. The Google Cloud Advantage: Orchestrate, Automate, Accelerate

We propose a transformation built on three strategic pillars designed specifically for onboarding risk assessment:

### Pillar 1: **Orchestrate** All Risk Checks Through a Unified Engine
By routing all onboarding applications through a central **Risk Decision Engine**, we create a single point of orchestration. This engine coordinates seven categories of risk evaluation—from document verification to third-party checks—ensuring comprehensive assessment while maintaining fast response times.

### Pillar 2: **Automate** Decisions with Intelligent Rules and AI
The platform combines configurable business rules with machine learning models to automate the majority of onboarding decisions. Internal services (list screening, rule engine, limits, reserves, scoring) work alongside external providers (Forter, name screening, web presence checks, document verification, transaction laundering detection, credit checks) to provide comprehensive risk assessment without manual intervention.

### Pillar 3: **Accelerate** Approvals for Legitimate Customers
By leveraging Google Cloud's managed services and serverless architecture, the platform delivers risk decisions in seconds, not hours or days. Good customers experience frictionless onboarding, while suspicious applications are automatically flagged for review or blocked, optimizing both customer experience and risk management.
