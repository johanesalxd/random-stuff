# Architecture & Phased Implementation: Onboarding Risk Assessment Platform

This document contains the architectural diagrams and phased implementation roadmap for the Onboarding Risk Assessment Platform on Google Cloud.

---

## 1. System Architecture Overview

This diagram illustrates the end-to-end onboarding risk assessment process, showing how the Risk Decision Engine orchestrates various risk evaluation components and produces actionable outputs.

### Diagram 1: Onboarding Process Flow

**Key Components:**
- **Process Flow**: The main data flow from onboarding checkpoint through the Risk API to the Decision Engine
- **Risk Evaluation Components**: Seven categories of risk checks performed by the engine
- **Outputs**: Three types of actions taken based on risk decisions

## 2. Service Integration Architecture

This diagram shows the central role of the Risk Decision Engine in orchestrating a combination of internal microservices and external third-party products and services.

### Diagram 2: Risk Decision Engine Integration

**Key Components:**
- **Internal Services**: Six internal microservices that provide core risk capabilities
- **Risk Decision Engine**: The core orchestration layer managing workflows, policies, and automation
- **External Products & Services**: Six third-party integrations for specialized risk assessments

**Integration Patterns:**
- Both internal and external services use bidirectional communication (↔) with the Decision Engine
- All services are called in parallel for optimal performance
- Results are aggregated and weighted according to business rules
