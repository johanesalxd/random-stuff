# Technical Narrative: Onboarding Risk Assessment Platform on Google Cloud

This document provides a detailed technical guide for implementing the onboarding risk assessment platform on Google Cloud. It translates the business vision into a concrete engineering plan, focusing on component architecture, integration patterns, and implementation approach.

The core objective is to build a real-time, orchestrated risk assessment system that evaluates onboarding applications through seven comprehensive risk categories while integrating both internal services and external providers.

---

## 1. System Architecture Overview

The platform is built around a central **Risk Decision Engine** that orchestrates all risk evaluation activities. Applications flow through an **Onboarding Risk Checkpoint** to a **Risk API**, which coordinates with the engine to perform comprehensive risk assessment and deliver decisions to downstream systems.
