# Business Narrative: Unified Risk Management Platform on Google Cloud

## 1. Executive Summary

In today's dynamic financial landscape, risk management cannot be siloed. Onboarding fraud, transaction fraud, and money laundering are interconnected threats that require a unified, intelligent response. Legacy systems that separate onboarding risk assessment from transaction monitoring create dangerous gaps that sophisticated fraudsters exploit.

This document outlines a strategic vision for building a **unified, intelligent, and real-time risk management platform on Google Cloud** that serves both onboarding and transaction monitoring use cases. By consolidating all risk capabilities into a single platform with shared intelligence, you can detect threats faster, reduce operational costs, and provide a seamless customer experience across the entire customer lifecycle.

## 2. The Challenge: The Cost of Fragmented Risk Management

Organizations that maintain separate systems for onboarding and transaction monitoring face compounding challenges:

| Pain Point | Business Impact |
|:---|:---|
| **Siloed Intelligence** | Insights from onboarding don't inform transaction monitoring, and vice versa. A customer flagged during onboarding may slip through transaction monitoring. |
| **Duplicate Infrastructure** | Maintaining two separate platforms doubles operational costs, engineering effort, and technical debt. |
| **Inconsistent Decisions** | Different systems using different rules and models lead to inconsistent risk decisions and customer confusion. |
| **Slow Threat Response** | New fraud patterns identified in transactions can't quickly update onboarding checks, allowing continued exposure. |
| **Data Fragmentation** | Customer risk profiles are incomplete when onboarding and transaction data live in separate systems. |
| **Compliance Complexity** | Proving end-to-end compliance is difficult when data and decisions are scattered across multiple platforms. |

## 3. The Google Cloud Advantage: Unify, Intelligently, Accelerate

We propose a transformation built on three strategic pillars that apply across both onboarding and transaction monitoring:

### Pillar 1: **Unify** to Create a Single Source of Truth
By consolidating all customer, transaction, and risk data into **BigQuery**, we eliminate silos. The same Risk Decision Engine serves both onboarding applications and real-time transactions, ensuring consistent risk assessment and enabling holistic customer risk profiles.

### Pillar 2: **Intelligently** Embed AI at the Core
The platform is designed to be AI-native across both use cases. Custom fraud models trained on combined onboarding and transaction data are more accurate than siloed models. Google's pre-trained models for AML and document verification accelerate development while providing industry-leading accuracy.

### Pillar 3: **Accelerate** Your Time-to-Market
By using serverless, managed services and a shared platform architecture, you eliminate duplicate development effort. A single Risk Decision Engine, one set of risk evaluation components, and unified data infrastructure serve both use cases, dramatically reducing time and cost to market.

*   **Lower False Positives:** Consistent risk assessment reduces customer friction

### Enhanced Customer Experience
*   **Consistent Treatment:** Same risk logic applied at onboarding and in transactions
*   **Faster Decisions:** Shared infrastructure and caching benefit both use cases
*   **Reduced Friction:** Good customers experience seamless onboarding and frictionless transactions

### Simplified Compliance
*   **Unified Audit Trail:** Complete customer journey from onboarding through transactions
*   **Consistent Policies:** Same compliance rules applied across all touchpoints
*   **Simplified Reporting:** Single source of truth for regulatory reporting

## 5. The Unified Platform Vision

### 5.1 Dual-Use Case Architecture

The platform serves two primary use cases through a shared Risk Decision Engine:

**Use Case 1: Onboarding Risk Assessment**
- Entry point: Onboarding Risk Checkpoint
- Purpose: Evaluate new users/merchants during signup
- Decision types: Approve, Deny, Manual Review
- Latency target: < 5 seconds
- Volume: Thousands of applications per day

**Use Case 2: Transaction Monitoring**
- Entry point: Real-time transaction stream
- Purpose: Detect fraud in ongoing transactions
- Decision types: Allow, Block, Flag for Review
- Latency target: < 100 milliseconds
- Volume: Millions of transactions per day

### 5.2 Shared Risk Evaluation Components

Both use cases leverage the same seven categories of risk evaluation:

1. **Document Verification** - Validate identity documents (onboarding) and transaction receipts
2. **Screening** - Check against sanctions, blacklists, and compliance lists
3. **Risk Scoring** - Fraud, credit, and AML risk assessment
4. **Web Presence** - Verify business legitimacy and reputation
5. **Policy Checks** - Enforce limits, reserves, and channel requirements
6. **Special Rules** - Apply segment and industry-specific logic
7. **Third Party** - Leverage external verification and fraud detection services

### 5.3 Shared Services Architecture

The platform integrates both internal and external services that serve both use cases:

**Internal Services:**
- List Screening: Shared watchlists and blocklists
- Rule Engine: Unified business rules and policies
- Limits: Consolidated limit management
- Reserves: Unified reserve tracking
- Scoring: Shared ML models and scoring logic
- Custom Fraud Engine: Proprietary fraud detection across all touchpoints

**External Services:**
- Forter: Fraud prevention for both onboarding and transactions
- Name Screening: Sanctions and PEP screening
- Web Presence: Business verification
- Doc Verification: Identity and document authentication
- Txn Laundering: Transaction pattern analysis
- Credit Checks: Credit risk assessment

## 6. Intelligence Feedback Loops

The unified platform creates powerful feedback loops that improve risk detection over time:

### Onboarding → Transaction Monitoring
- Customers flagged during onboarding are monitored more closely in transactions
- Document verification signals inform transaction fraud models
- Onboarding risk scores become features for transaction models

### Transaction Monitoring → Onboarding
- Fraud patterns detected in transactions update onboarding rules
- Customers with suspicious transactions trigger re-verification
- Transaction behavior validates or invalidates onboarding decisions

### Continuous Learning
- Models trained on combined onboarding and transaction data
- Fraud typologies identified in one use case immediately applied to the other
- Shared feature store ensures consistent risk signals across use cases

---

## 7. Data Platform Integration

The unified platform is deeply integrated with the central data platform on BigQuery:

### Real-Time Path
- **Onboarding:** Synchronous API calls for instant decisions
