# Xendit Data Platform Migration: Partner Engagement Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines a high-level scope and a 3-month timeline for a partner to assist Xendit in migrating their data analytics platform from AWS (Databricks) to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The engagement is structured in two phases, starting with a partner-led foundational setup and transitioning to a Xendit-led migration with partner support.

## 2. Partner's Scope of Work

The partner's engagement will be divided into two main phases:

**Phase 1: Foundation & Enablement (Partner-Led)**

The primary objective of this phase is to establish a solid data analytics foundation on GCP and to enable the Xendit team with the necessary skills to undertake the migration.

*   **Infrastructure Setup:**
    *   Deploy and configure the core data services on GCP, including BigQuery, Dataproc, and Cloud Composer.
    *   Set up the necessary networking, IAM, and security configurations.
*   **Data Foundation:**
    *   Implement a canonical data model and a medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) in BigQuery.
    *   Establish data governance and data quality frameworks using Dataplex.
*   **Enablement & Training:**
    *   Conduct a "BigQuery 101" workshop for the Xendit team.
    *   Provide hands-on training on the new data platform and the migration process.
*   **Pilot Migration:**
    *   Lead the migration of a pilot workload to demonstrate the process and best practices.

**Phase 2: Migration & Scaling (Xendit-Led, Partner-Supported)**

In this phase, the Xendit team will take the lead in migrating their workloads, with the partner providing expert guidance and support.

*   **Advisory & Support:**
    *   Provide on-demand support and expert guidance to the Xendit team.
    *   Assist in troubleshooting and resolving any technical issues.
*   **Migration of Complex Workloads:**
    *   Provide specialized support for migrating Xendit's customized solutions from Databricks.
*   **Performance Optimization:**
    *   Assist in optimizing the performance of the migrated workloads on BigQuery.
*   **Handover & Closure:**
    *   Ensure a smooth handover of the migrated platform to the Xendit team.
    *   Provide final documentation and a summary of the engagement.
